A technical implementation of this might be something like 802.1AE/MACSec\nsequenceDiagram autonumber participant L as Laptop/PC participant N as Network participant P as Printer L-\u003e\u003eN: Encrypted N-\u003e\u003eP: Encrypted P-\u003e\u003eP: Queueing (encrypted at rest) P-\u003e\u003eP: PrintingScenario B: Transport Encryption is Provided by the Printer\rThe computer establishes an encrypted channel with the printer directly, over an unencrypted network.
